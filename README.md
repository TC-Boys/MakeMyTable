# MakeMyTable
Welcome to the College Timetable Management System. This system simplifies the process of creating efficient and comprehensive timetables for all divisions in your college.
Enter the name of the new subject you wish to add to the timetable.
Specify the number of classes per week for this subject, ranging from 1 to 10.
Select the teacher who will be teaching this subject from the list of available teachers.
The system automatically generates timetables for all divisions based on the added subjects and teacher availability.
The system optimizes class schedules, ensuring minimal conflicts and maximizing teacher utilization.
Teachers and administrators can customize the generated timetables to meet specific requirements or preferences.
Future Improvements: With the feedbacks from the users we will improve it by improving the interface and bugs in that app.
The app is online, we want to make a offline which can be accessed anytime without any data usage.
There are some voids in the timetable after generating timetable, we will improve it in the upcoming versions.
In Android, we want to add a slider to change the no. of lectures in a week.
We want to add the logo of MMCOE in it.
We also want to add a login feature so that the timetable will remain save and can be accessable afterwards.
